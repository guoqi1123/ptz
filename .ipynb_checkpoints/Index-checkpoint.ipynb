It is specially targeted for people in non-engineering areas such as social sciences, medical sciences, finance, art, etc., with focus in data analysis. The tutorial consists of existing online materials filtered by the author, and customly developed exercises. The tutorial is actively under development, and the author welcomes all suggestions and feedbacks. "

    "## 1. Programming languages in a nutshell\n",
    "\n",
    "Humans use languages to interact with each other, and programming languages enable the interaction between a human and a computer. A computer chip is designed to only read binary commands, like those \"0110110101\" -- these binary commands must be translated to *another language* before can be understood by humans. Thus, humans invented programming languages that are suitable for the interpretation by programmers, and at the same time could be automatically *compiled* to operatable binary commands for the machines. Read [this](http://guyhaas.com/bfoit/itp/Programming.html) webpage if you are interested in learning more about programming languages.\n",

    "Python is a programming language that is highly interpretable to people. It is especially suitable for scripting computer programs in a short amount of time for research and prototyping, thus Python is widely adopted nowadays in machine learning and data science communities. In return, people in these communites developed a bunch of handy programming tools called *packages* and *modules* that even facilitate Python programming.  "

We will use the [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) as our interactive development environment (IDE). The Jupyter Notebook is a very convenient, widely-used Python coding environment that you already saw. Yes, you are right. This tutorial is written in Jupyter Notebook!"

On macOS, if using the GUI (.pkg) installer, youâ€™ll get an icon for Navigator in Launchpad. On Linux or macOS installed via .sh installer, open a terminal and enter this command:\n",

    "\n",
    "An advantage of Anaconda is that it provides very good managements of *Python environments*. A Python environment consists of all outside packages and modules that the Python compiler will see when running a program. As previously said, Python programmers will almost surely use a myrid of *packages* in their projects to facilitate development, and different Python projects may require different outside packages. It is highly possible that potential conflicts arise between packages required for different projects. Thus it is important to create independent Python environment for different projects, so that conflicting outside packages will be invisible to each other. \n",
